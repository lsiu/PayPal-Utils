PayPal Utility
=============

Secure your PayPal dynamic buttons by encrypting it. 

In order to use this utility, you need to prepare your PayPal account to handle 
the information in encrypted format. If you just want to test this out, you may 
want to register just a [Sandbox account](http://www.sandbox.paypal.com).

Please refer to Paypal's guide on [Securing Your PayPal Payments Standard 
Buttons](https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_html_encryptedwebpayments)
